# Getting Started with Ventyd

Welcome to Ventyd! This guide will help you understand what Ventyd is and how to get started with event sourcing in TypeScript.

## What is Ventyd?

Ventyd is a **TypeScript-first event sourcing library** that helps you build applications where every state change is captured as an immutable event. Think of it as a complete audit trail for your application's data.

### Why Event Sourcing?

Traditional applications store only the current state of your data. Event sourcing is different - it stores **all the events** that led to the current state. This is like having a complete history of everything that happened in your application.

**Example:** Instead of just storing a user's current email address, you store:
1. `user:created` - User signed up with email `john@example.com`
2. `user:email_updated` - Email changed to `john.doe@example.com`
3. `user:email_updated` - Email changed to `johndoe@company.com`

This gives you powerful capabilities:

- **Complete Audit Trail** - Know exactly what happened, when, and why
- **Time Travel** - Reconstruct your data at any point in history
- **Event Replay** - Rebuild your database from scratch using events
- **Debugging** - Understand exactly how bugs occurred

## How It Works

Ventyd follows a simple pattern:

1. **Define your schema** - Describe your events and state using a validation library
2. **Create a reducer** - Define how events transform your state
3. **Build your entity** - Add business logic as methods
4. **Set up storage** - Connect to your database with an adapter
5. **Use it!** - Create, update, and query your entities

```typescript
// 1. Define schema
const userSchema = defineSchema("user", {
  schema: valibot({
    event: {
      created: v.object({
        email: v.pipe(v.string(), v.email())
      })
    },
    state: v.object({
      email: v.string()
    })
  }),
  initialEventName: "user:created"
});

// 2. Create reducer
const userReducer = defineReducer(userSchema, (prevState, event) => {
  if (event.eventName === "user:created") {
    return { email: event.body.email };
  }
  return prevState;
});

// 3. Build entity
class User extends Entity(userSchema, userReducer) {
  get email() {
    return this.state.email;
  }
}

// 4. Set up storage
const userRepository = createRepository(User, {
  adapter: createInMemoryAdapter()
});

// 5. Use it!
const user = User.create({
  body: { email: "john@example.com" }
});
await userRepository.commit(user);
```
